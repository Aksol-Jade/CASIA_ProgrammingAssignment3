# CASIA Programming Assignment 3

This notebook contains the final assignment analysis for CASIA's Programming Assignment 3. It explores, models, and evaluates facial expression data, integrating classification and regression methods to interpret behavior signals.

## 🧠 Project Objective
To apply machine learning techniques (both classification and regression) on preprocessed CASIA dataset features and evaluate model performance based on accuracy, error metrics, and prediction visuals.

## 📁 Content Summary

- **Data Exploration**
  - Load structured dataset (e.g., CSV format)
  - Visualize distribution of categories, classes, and relevant labels

- **Preprocessing**
  - Handle missing values, encode categorical data
  - Normalize or scale features as needed

- **Modeling Approaches**
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - (Optional) Decision Trees or other classifiers

- **Evaluation & Visualization**
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Accuracy, MSE, MAE
  - Actual vs. Predicted Plots

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Ensure the dataset is available in `.csv` format and properly referenced
2. Open `CASIA_Programming_Assignment3.ipynb` in Jupyter or VSCode
3. Run all cells to perform EDA, modeling, and evaluation

## 📌 Requirements
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## 🔍 Key Insights
This notebook demonstrates the end-to-end workflow for a facial behavior analysis assignment using traditional ML models. Ideal as a student baseline or instructional reference.
